# Angular 2

## Notes

* The `@` connotation above a class, is for annotations.
  * These usually take an object that outlines information for the class.
  * Two that are particularly important are `Component` and `Template`
* Constructor functions often times ask Angular to instantiates the dependencies and types.
  * This is actually not dependency injection but IoC(Inversion of Control)

### Templates

* Every template will have it's own `style` tag.
  * This can be imported using the `import url()` syntax or can be written inline.
