##Notes

* Think of class definition when working with AR
* `defaults:` is a key/value set that adds properties to each
newly initiated model
* use `get` and `set` methods so proper watchers will be fired
* A model will often have a bunch of methods
* models are often built prior to a interface so they can be tricky
