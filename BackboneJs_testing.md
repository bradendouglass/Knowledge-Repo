##Notes

* When starting an application it is best to devise a test plan.
  * This is really due to the fact that TDD may not be the best plan in a FrontEnd app.
  * These can be either simple sketches or multi page, drudge reports that require sign off.
  * Sometimes Wiki's make for good test plans as well.
