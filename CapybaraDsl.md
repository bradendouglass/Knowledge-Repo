#Capybara

##Notes

The language that you use to match items with Rspec and Cucumber

* `gem 'capybara'`
* more readable DSL docs can be found: [here][1]
* If completely lost `save_and_open_page` to see what is being rendered

## Clicking Tips

* When there is no text to click on, use a scope like: `find('.some-class').click`
