# Coding Best Practices
##Notes

* Always have an else (you never know what error will occur)
* Programmers often assume everyone knows all the things they do
	* counteracting this leads to readable code

###Refactoring

* Best place to start is within blocks that are deeply nested
* Purpose is to increase readability/not reduce code
