# Coding Best Practices

##Notes

* Always have an else (you never know what error will occur)
* Programmers often assume everyone knows all the things they do
	* counteracting this leads to readable code

###Universal Truths

Very few of these across programming languages.

1. Minimize Mutable State.

##Refactoring

* Best place to start is within blocks that are deeply nested
* Purpose is to increase readability/not reduce code
* A way of looking at this could be in the following steps:
  * Make it right
  * Make it correct (clean and proper)
  * Make it beautiful
  * Make it simple
