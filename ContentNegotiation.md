# API Content Negotiation

## Notes

* A list of strategies in which multiple responses can occur from a single API endpoint.
* Some of these include the following:
  * GET/POST methods
  * Using params to define the output/input or acceptable response
  * Adding special headers to the request itself
  * Interpreting the resource through the url: `GET /users/all.json`
