##Notes

* npm start looks for server.js not the prebuilt app.js
	* node defaults are actually server.js
* Express is open ended when it comes to file/folder layout, do what you want
* [Jade][1] is the default template engine for Express
* `npm install library --save` will add lib to the current dir and add lib to package.json
	* if anything is wrong with package.json the error will fail silently and nothing will be written
