##General

* Express is fairly open so to better segment code, create an `apps/` dir
	* In the directory we can create a myriad of _little apps_ to keep code separate
* `req` item handles flash and session items
* `res` item handles rendering and redirect items

###Routes

* Url handling is key and with express you need to instantiate each url/route
	* This is very much like how [Sinatra][1] handles itself
