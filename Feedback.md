# Feedback

## Getting Folks to Listen.

* Start with a micro yes.
  * Remove uncertainty or surprise
* Talk more about what they do/did and not who they are.
  * Give data points and avoid at all costs interpretations.
  * This breaks down to blur words (awesome, always, too).
* When reaching for data points, reach for the most recent one.

## Make it Actionable.

* Make it as specific as possible.
  * Avoid the whole sense of 'great job'.
* LifeLab's Card Feedback:
  * club: Negative / not specific
  * spade: Negative / specific
  * heart: Positive / not specific
  * diamond: Positive / specific
* Feedback sandwhiches: nice/negative/nice or reverse.
  * The second positive feedback is seen as super in authentic.
  * This is still being taught and the research behind them is 35 years old.

## Making it Balanced

* Pairing negative feedback with positive if you want to stay positive is good.
* Get specific when asking for feedback.
  * This avoids the blur words mentioned in the first part.
  * Be relentless when asking for feedback and someone responds with blur words.
* Dig into feedback (especially if you get a club or heart).
  * Ask for examples or hypothesize a solution right on the fly.
* If giving feedback, ask a question at the end of it. Allow someone to share their perspective.
  * This can be hard but allows the other person to feel like they are heard.
  * Frame the last question in a sense that you do care about their 02 cents.
* When giving feedback up, make sure to flip the data and impact section of the Feedback grid.
