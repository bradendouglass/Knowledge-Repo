## Notes

* Large idea is point-free or tacit programming. 
  * function definitions do not expose the arguments but,
  * merely compose them.
* Three main functions found in most Functional languages:
  * `map`, `reduce`, `filter`
* Create your grammar (composed functions) then use it.
* Highlevel, abstract, declarative.
