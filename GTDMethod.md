###Notes
based on two key objectives:

1. capturing all the things that need to get done—now, later, someday, big, little, or in between—into a logical and trusted sys-tem outside of your head and off your mind
1. disciplining yourself to make front-end decisions about all of me "inputs" you let into your life so that you will always have a plan for "next actions" that you can implement or renegotiate at any moment

* Key to managing all the "stuff in life" is managing our actions.
* Real problems creep in when the project is without scope or what the next step is.

###Core Process

We go through 5 discrete stages as we deal with each piece of our work

1. _Collect_ things that commawnd our attention
1. _Process_ what they mean
1. _Organize_ the results
1. _Review_ as options for what we choose...
1. and finally, we _do_

###Steps for Successfull Collection

1. Every loop must be in your collection system and thereby out of your
   head.
1. You must have as few collections buckets as you can get by with
1. You must empty them regularly
