# Go Lang

### General Notes

* Printing can be done with `println` and `print` functions.
  * However importing the fmt package and calling `fmt.Println` and `fmt.Printf` is more favorable.
* Programs begin their execution in the main function.
  * This can be thought of as the entry point of the software.

### Imports

* Generally found at the beginning of the code, especially if using gofmt.
* Can be a single string or a web url.
* `go get` is the command to pull down these packages.
