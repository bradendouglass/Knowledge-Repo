### JS Wants from Community

* Being able to discern technologies that are good for people's needs/requirements. |
* Reviews of what is going on in the JS world
* Mitigating the myriad of the toolsets/tooling ||
* More lighter level where we focus on something as light as dev tools
* Node Core API items
* NPM and how that differentiates itself from Node
* Subset languages, CoffeeScript/Atscript/Typescript and transpilers
* Weird or unknowning JS features/functions/ideas/structs of the language
* More programming style stuff, ancillary stuff, programming in general.
* Slack resources for finding resources around the JS community.

* Slack channel roulette to decide the above stuff.
