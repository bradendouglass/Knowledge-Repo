# Video From StrangeLoop 2017 By Nat Welch

## Notes

* [Link to video][vid]
* Mostly about Communications/Monitoring/Outages/PostMortems.
* Heavily focused on SRE (Site Reliability).
* Mention of '[VCL][varn]', which is hilarious...
* Advocating the idea of 'integration tests' to compliment unit tests.
* Developing in the terms of the video means tooling or building tools.
  * Classic 'do we build it' or 'do we buy it'.
  * Priorities, priorities, priorities...
* Advocates getting outside of the business and asking what others are doing.
* Mentions 'UX' but, is talking about speed of load, and perceived downtime.

## Capacity Planning

* Advocates thinking about this early on.
* Highly focused on budgeting, even if there is no budget.
* How do certain features impact the potential to meet capacity?

## Communications

* Interesting ideas about what and how you are contacted during an incident:
  * Level 1 is a direct call.
  * Level 2 is a mention in Slack/Group Chat.
  * Level 3 is a shared graph.
