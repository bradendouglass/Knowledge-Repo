## Notes

* Structuring everything under JS folder within a folder called views.
  * every class (view) gets its own folder
  * code that needs sharing between models becomes a 'widget'

## JS

* `application_view` is default, inherited by all others.

## Needed Gems

* Turbolinks (included with rails4)
* [HeadJS][1]
