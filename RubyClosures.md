##Notes

* The ability to weasel away certain parameters into proc/lambda objects to be used later
  * {{RubyClosureExample}}
* All variables are stored as references and not in memory
  * This is somewhat different than some languages
* With 1.9, the `lambda` syntax can be substituded with `->`
	* sometimes refered to as 'stabby lambda'
	* check out [this][1] for more on lambdas
