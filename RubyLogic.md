# Ruby Logic

## Notes

## Flow control

* [For Loops][1]
* `If` and there opposite brothers the `Unless`
* `While` and there opposite brothers the `Until`
* `Times` is used to do something `n.times`.
* `Upto(n)` is somewhat like `times`.
  * ex: `0.upto(7) do |I| ; puts I ; end`
* `Begin` can be used as well as a bit of flow control
  * [Example][2]
