# Ruby On Rails

## Notes

* Printing the details of a method: `Class.method(:method_name).source.display`
  * if looking for just the location: `Class.method(:method_name).source_location`
  * this may only work in Rails5 and beyond.
* [Helpers][hpr] are accessible through the `helper` object in the console.

[hpr]: /ActionViewHelpers
