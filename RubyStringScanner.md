# Ruby StringScanner

* Actual standard lib class that can be used by requiring: `strscan`
* Comes with a bunch of fun and interesting ways to scan through a string.
* More importantly than anything it allows someone to know where they are during the scan process.
  * Super helpful to know if we are at the end of a string or if there is more to be searched.
