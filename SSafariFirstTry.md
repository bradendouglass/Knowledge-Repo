### Pains

(from individual threads: http://redd.it/2goy56 )

1. Finding a quality recurring delivery of beans
    * sellouts
    * shipments gotten better but seemed to be bad in the past
1. knowledge based information from the original Tonx site now not updated/outdated:
    * do people rely on this? Were they a large funnel for coffee information?
1. limited access to specialty or rare realeased beans. Not even BlueBottle does this now
    * quality hard to derive or find from larger roasters although they can source beans
1. lack of open access to bean acquisition leads to people not trusting the sourced beans
    * due to this, the idea of "lower grade coffee" prevalent
    * skeptical of overall quality control, this likely bleeds into the Blue bottle entire brand
    * scared of paying for a subpar product even though subpar seems unquatified
1. paying large amounts of shipping cost for perhaps one bag of coffee
1. Having to buy 12oz bags is hard for a subscription due to the amount of coffee.
    * finding subscriptions that offer 6oz offerings is hard
    * it is hard to try new and varying coffees when less than 12oz subscriptions are offered
    * unknown uses for the extra coffee beans that inevitaly occur when subsscribing to 12oz bags
1. Good local coffee might be harder or somewhat impossible to find.
    * this leads people to go back to Blue Bottle and their inferior product
    * local roasters are a bit more of a mystery outside of Sf
    * and when found, the chances of their beans being wildly different than yesterday is prevalent
1. Subscriptions don't fit everyone and some/better roasters don't offer them
    * although it seems variety might be hard to achieve if a subscription is not in place
    * interesting outlook to the whole subscription idea:
    * > When you buy a car you check its features, its price and then take it for a test drive. At the end of a test drive you still look at or consider other cars if the first one you tried fell short somehow.
1. Hard to articulate why some coffees aren't as good as others. Even for seemingly long time drinkers
