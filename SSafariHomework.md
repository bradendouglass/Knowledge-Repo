### Pains

1. finding qualified younger candidates
    * seems like our profiles, ideas are much harder to synthesize* seems like our profiles, ideas are much harder  to synthesize
1. Connecting through linkedin is futile
    * although this thread focuses on it, it seems to be an issue shared by many
1. There is no single resource for findin qualified candidates
    * talent sector wise this is almost impossible with linkedin
1. top talent aquisiton with linkedin is doubly hard, if not impossible
1. Databases seem to be difficult to sift through, almost time consuming to the point of futility
1. costs can somewhat be large. Mentions of up to 800 over a monthly timeframe for a co-founder
    * Otherwise this large costs sometimes leads to unrealistic relationship which further drives recruitment costs
    * many of these candidates start out with a higher than average salary requirement
1. sort of deals with the previous, impossible to discern good from bad
1. Lack of trully objective review of the people currently looking for a job

### Jargon

* mature markets
* mid career professionals
* hiring managers
* red sea strategy
* starve to death
* source candidates


### Worldview

* Seemingly very negative. Hiring is a hard gig
* Impossible, or perhaps unlikely to discern a good candidate from a bad
* Accepting that there isn't one stop shops for hiring
    * willing to search around until something that works is found.
