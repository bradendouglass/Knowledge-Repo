###Pains list

1. People feel stressed out when their inbox is burdened (to them) with email
2. Working a normal job, one that doesn't reward flexible hours, impedes you from writing books.
3. Marketplaces for selling self published books arent readily available/apparent.
4. These book marketplaces seem to have a ranking algorythm like that of Google. Where one needs to correctly position their book using keywords and categories in order to be "found"
5. Items that generate passive income often are not immediately successful. They take a consistent amount of upfront energy to get their ball rolling.
6. People value Consumer Reports however, their site search and indexing is lackluster and makes for retrieval of past products way in the past difficult or perhaps impossible
7. Books that teach people how to write code often times don't have enough practice examples that build logically from one to another
8. Washable Cat-Shitteroo pellets are not available in all Cat shiteing systems therefore leading folks with shitty cats to throw away there pellets and buy more
9. Large images, like those that depict before and after pictures of rooms are hard to scale on the plethora of viewports/screens
10. It is best to tackle home improvement in chuncks but scheduleing this and keeping to the schedule is difficult and therefore expensive.

###Revisiting Our List Safari For Pains

####Copied from what I deduced last week

1. finding qualified younger candidates
    * seems like our profiles, ideas are much harder to synthesize* seems like our profiles, ideas are much harder  to synthesize
1. Connecting through linkedin is futile
    * although this thread focuses on it, it seems to be an issue shared by many
1. There is no single resource for findin qualified candidates
    * talent sector wise this is almost impossible with linkedin
1. top talent aquisiton with linkedin is doubly hard, if not impossible
1. Databases seem to be difficult to sift through, almost time consuming to the point of futility
1. costs can somewhat be large. Mentions of up to 800 over a monthly timeframe for a co-founder
    * Otherwise this large costs sometimes leads to unrealistic relationship which further drives recruitment costs
    * many of these candidates start out with a higher than average salary requirement
1. sort of deals with the previous, impossible to discern good from bad
1. Lack of trully objective review of the people currently looking for a job

#### Information discerned this week

1. The top listed keyword through last weeks work was definitely "candidate". This would make
sense due to this being the focal point of the whole career.
1. Although, quality candidates exist in the pool of potential candidates, these people are constantly
being offered positions which allows them to be flakey.
1. Candidates often have their own complicated, although not upfront about the complications, process
for hiring which slows the process down and the candidate escapes to another company that was quicker
1. Passive candidates are oftentimes looking to change jobs however, are difficult and sometimes impossible
to find.
1. The above goes along with another common used keyword: database/databases/datasources.
1. Having a plethora of sources for candidate discovery muddys the water and makes finding qualified, hireable
candidates a pain
1. Attention was another pretty common word.
1. Many companies can't get attention or aren't of interest to candidates due to their lack of
openness concerning their compensation packages and perks.

Title: Fill Your Passive Candidate Pool (To the Brim) Using Github

Every recruiter knows it. There are amazing people out there who are currently employed but, passively looking
for a career change. However, how do you tap into this rich vein of skilled engineers? Moreover, how do you get
them to pay attention to you know so you can help them when a job comes up? Well, glad you asked. Here are a few ways
to discover great engineers for passive candidate sourcing using only the power of GitHub.

1. A technical recruiters best GitHub friend is GitHub's [explore tab][1]. They hand anyone, that's right you don't even need to have
account for this, a sensible list of categories that likely coinside with many of the job posting requirements sitting on your desk.
Looking for someone proficient in "Web application frameworks" or "DevOps"? Yep, they have those categories or buckets already created
for you. Just pop into one, click on a project and peruse the developers who have ever given their time to working on it. Don't just look
at the top contributors either, Look through everyone! No matter how long the list of contributors is.
1. Here's a tip that most engineers will never devulge but is always true. We are always open to a new, better,
shinier, job. It's just the recruiters, your job to figure out what style of code want to be writing.
This is easy, every profile on GitHub has a repositories tab. Inside you will find what we are working, when, along with the kicker:
frequency. Beside this information, just slightly to the right there exists the language that is predominate in each project.
Does a programmer have an inordinate amount of public Ruby projects? You can make an educated guess that they love writing beautiful Ruby
code and will likely jump at most opportunities that you float by them where Ruby is a requirement. If the job doesn't suite them, maybe, since
they are involved in the community, they know someone who is more suited to fill the position. Win-Win!
1. You now have a collection of people who work on projects that are catagorized through GitHub. You also know what they want to work on
and ultimately what they might leave their current position for, if you reached out to them. But how do you continue to fill up your passive candidate
pool? Easy, through their connections. Click back through each one of their public projects. Guarenteed that a few of them will have some friends of theirs
in the collaborators section or talking to them through the issues section. All of these people are fare game when a candidate needs to be quicly placed.
The potential for candidates really is endless!

Finding a dirth of candidates who you can target like a lazer for your next placement are really just sitting their waiting for you on GitHub.
Don't be an uninformed recruiter, use this knowledge to reapidly place candidates every time.
