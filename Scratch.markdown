###Stuff that would break my brain

*Server Build* 
If `bundle install --deployment` it should only pull development stuff
Cap webkit gem requires libqt4-dev and dependencies installed to work  
Nokogiri needs libxslt1-dev and ependeciet to work  
Sqlite needs libsqlite3-dev to get things working  
Nodejs way easier to install through a git pull
