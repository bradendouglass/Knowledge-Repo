###[Notes][1]

* If a change occurs and a class contains > 1 responsibility then there
will be more than one reason for it to change
* This is also known as being coupled
  * When the responsibilities change they will likely negatively affect
  the other responsibility
* The idea really stretches to "Decoupling two or more interfaces"
  * There will likely be instances where there is a small amount of
  "glue" holding things together.
