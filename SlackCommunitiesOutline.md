# Slack Communities Outline

## Intro

* Talk briefly about communities in general
  * BBS or Bulletin Boards
  * IRC Internet Relay Chat
  * Email lists 
  * Internet Forums
  * Social Networks
* Resurgence of IRC over the last 5 to 10 years, really the one of the few items that hasn't changed much over the years.

## Slack For Yobs

* Slack stormed over Hipchat and Campfire in no time.
* Companies jumped on the ubiquity across platforms as a viable and easy communication method that everyone seemed to love.
* Communication, weirdly between communities and companies are remarkably similar.
  * asynchronous (really really big deal)
  * searchable
  * archiveable

## Slack Now (beyond the company)

* Many folks who use tools like Slack are likely a part of a remote or partially remote team. These people crave connection to people during the day.
* Many of these people look to connect with folks within their same discipline.
* Why not create Slack communities to allow these people to connect with each other. 
* This is not discimilar to the world of IRC.
  * diff being that one slack channel can have a myriad of sub channels.
  * all content is searchable, archiveable and all history is easily read
  * access is ubiquitious and across multiple devises

## Slack Communities

* A world of knowledge sitting in its catagorized space
* Remote/Nomadic workers led a lot of the charge.
* Now many developer focused communities have moved from IRC to Slack.
* Answers, jobs, code snippets, and more are available on a platform that is everywhere and somewhat full of notifications.
