##Notes

* Basic math is fairly easy (`+,-,/,*`)
* Squaring, tangents, etc are all done through specific functions
* Modulo is performed by: `select mod(<num>,<num>)`
* `ceil(), floor(), round(), and truncate()` are all legit
  * `round()` is performed in a logical rounding way
    * takes an optional second argument to determine how many spaces
    after decimal
    * `truncate()` works identical to round except it does no rounding,
    just removing digits
