# Teaching Programmers

## Notes

## Unimportant things.

### Precise

* Counter intuitive because precision is a good thing for programming.
* The more precise you are, the more winding road someone has to take to learn.

### Details

* If it's Googlable, leave it out.
* Trust the students to fill in the gaps.
* Focus on the hard stuff that's not Googleable.

### Entertaining

* Often times it's super distracting.
* Lose a lot of effectiveness during the learning process.
