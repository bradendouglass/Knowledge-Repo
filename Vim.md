##Notes

* `Copen and Lopen` are used to see quickfix and list view items
  * `cN` and `lN` are used to cycle through these windows.
  * It something is supposed to open in the quickfix window and it doesnt, check by opening the quickfix window using the above command. For some reason [[Neovim]] doesn't open this automagically.

###Motion

* In many cases `/` is the fastest way to get from point a to b
