# IOS Development

## Notes

* Most apps are built using Storyboards which are a visual representation of the flow through an app.
  * Segues manage interactions from one storyboard item to another.

## View Controller (UIViewController)

* Blank scenes that hold UI Elements (think custom interfaces).

## Table View Controller (UITableViewController)

* Common element used to display a list of items.

## Collection View Controller (UICollectionViewController)

* Collection of items that are not constrained to a grid.

## Navigation Controller (UINavigationController)

* Manage navigation through something like a Collection.

## Tab Bar Controller (UITabBarController)

* Manages an array of View Controllers (think tab bars at the bottom of iPhones).
